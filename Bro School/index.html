            <div class="text-box">I'm writing about my audience for this page because I want to clearly define who Bro School serves and highlight the unique value it offers to both students and mentors. By understanding their needs and motivations, I can tailor the message to attract passionate mentors who are eager to share their expertise and students who are driven to learn through real-world experiences. This will help create a strong community where everyone benefits from growth, knowledge exchange, and practical learning.</div>
