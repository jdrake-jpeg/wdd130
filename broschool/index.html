                <h1>Welcome to Bro School: The Future of Education</h1>
                <p>Bro School is not your typical classroom—it’s an experience. Built on the foundation of hands-on learning, real-world applications, and mentorship from industry professionals, Bro School is a revolutionary approach to education. Instead of sitting in a classroom all day, reading from outdated textbooks and cramming for tests, our students engage in field learning, business tours, and apprenticeships, all designed to prepare them for success in the real world.</p>

            <h1>color scheme</h1>
            <p>The color scheme for Bro School was chosen to reflect the modern, professional, and bold identity of our program. Our primary colors—black (#000000), white (#FFFFFF), and charcoal gray (#333333)—maintain a clean, sleek aesthetic that aligns with the logo and reinforces our strong, no-nonsense approach to education. These colors create a sense of professionalism and clarity, ensuring that our content is easy to read and visually appealing.

                To add depth and contrast, we’re incorporating muted gold (#C4A86A) and deep navy (#1E3A5F) as accent colors. Gold represents excellence, ambition, and the value of real-world learning, while navy adds a subtle energy that enhances the modern feel of the site without overwhelming it. This combination keeps the site visually engaging while staying true to Bro School’s identity—bold, effective, and built for success.</p>
