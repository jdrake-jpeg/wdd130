        <h1>Our Teaching Methodologies</h1>
        <p>At Bro School, we believe that true learning happens through experience, not just instruction. Our methodologies are built around active engagement, critical thinking, and real-world problem-solving. We prioritize hands-on learning over memorization, ensuring that students don’t just absorb knowledge—they apply it. Our approach includes project-based learning, where students work on real-world business problems, mentorship-driven education, where they receive guidance from industry professionals, and immersive field experiences, such as business tours and apprenticeships. We adapt to each student’s unique interests and strengths, allowing them to develop skills that align with their passions while building the confidence to navigate the challenges of the real world.</p>
