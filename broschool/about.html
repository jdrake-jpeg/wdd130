        <h1>About Bro School</h1>
        <p>At Bro School, we believe that education should be more than just memorization and test-taking—it should be an adventure that prepares students for the real world. Founded on the idea that hands-on experience is the key to success, Bro School offers a unique, mentorship-driven approach to learning. We’ve reimagined what high school can be, replacing traditional lectures with immersive field experiences, business tours, and real-world problem-solving. Our goal is simple: to create a generation of self-reliant, skilled, and entrepreneurial individuals who are ready to take on the world.</p>
        <h2>Why Bro School?</h2>
        <p2>Traditional education often falls short in preparing students for real-life challenges. Many high school graduates step into the world without practical knowledge of business, finance, or even basic life skills. Bro School was created to fill that gap. We believe that learning should be dynamic, immersive, and, most importantly, relevant. Our program allows students to explore a variety of industries, work with mentors, and gain hands-on experience that will set them apart in their careers.</p2>
        <h3>What We Offer</h3>
        <p3>1. Hands-on Learning: Our students don’t just learn theory; they apply it. Whether it’s shadowing a CEO, learning how to invest in real estate, or developing a marketing strategy, Bro School ensures that learning is interactive and applicable.
            2. Business & Industry Tours: Instead of limiting education to a classroom, we take students on company visits, behind-the-scenes business operations, and even networking events to understand how industries operate.
            3. Apprenticeships & Mentorship: One of the most valuable aspects of Bro School is our mentorship network. We connect students with successful entrepreneurs, investors, and business leaders who guide them in their journey, sharing insights they wish they had learned earlier.
            4. Personal & Professional Growth: Bro School isn't just about academic success—it’s about developing the whole person. We emphasize leadership, decision-making, problem-solving, and financial literacy. Our students leave with the skills and confidence to thrive in whatever path they choose.

        <h3>Who Should Join?</h3>
        <p4>Bro School is for students who are driven, curious, and ready to take control of their education. If you feel uninspired by traditional school systems and want to learn in an environment where every experience adds value to your future, then Bro School is for you. We focus on self-starters who are eager to learn and willing to put in the work.</p4>
        <h3>Why a Website?</h3>
        <p5>Until now, Bro School has been an exclusive, word-of-mouth experience. But we knew we needed a central hub where people could learn about our vision, see our impact, and get involved. This website serves as our digital home, making it easier than ever for students, parents, and mentors to see why Bro School is changing the game.</p5>
        <h3>Join the Movement</h3>
